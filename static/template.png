Add a Certificate template without the name of the participant - make sure the name space is in the centre of the certificate. 
Don't ask me anything, i made this to solve my own problem when i gotta print 300+ cerificates in 1 night.
I created an extended version which can read a Excel sheet and print "n" number of certificates -  you want it - ping me on instagram @iam.shan.jo
